## Methods

Methods are functions that are declared with a receiver which binds the method to a type. Methods can be used to operate on values or pointers of that type.

## Notes

* Methods are functions that declare a receiver variable.
* Receivers bind a method to a type and can use value or pointer semantics.
* Value semantics mean a copy of the value is passed across program boundaries.
* Pointer semantics mean a copy of the values address is passed across program boundaries.
* Stick to a single semantic for a given type and be consistent.

## Quotes

_"Methods are valid when it is practical or reasonable for a piece of data to expose a capability." - William Kennedy_

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Declare a struct that represents a baseball player. Include name, atBats and hits. Declare a method that calculates a players batting average. The formula is Hits / AtBats. Declare a slice of this type and initialize the slice with several players. Iterate over the slice displaying the players name and batting average.
